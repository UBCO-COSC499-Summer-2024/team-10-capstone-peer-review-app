### Envisioned Usage

Here are the user scenarios for each user group:

1. **Students:** Students will begin by creating/registering their accounts or logging in using their credentials. Once logged in, they will be presented with their personalized class dashboard, where they can view vital class/assignment information. Furthermore, the user's dashboard will utilize graphical quick link cards, links, buttons, etc to quickly navigate and further enhance the user experience. Within each class, students can view assignments and submission deadlines. A deadline will exist for each assignment and the student can view the deadline date/time for each assignment on the assignments tab. Similarly, there will be a peer-review tab that hosts assignments that are allocated to the current user by the instructor and the student can view every assignment they are required to peer-review. After the submission deadline passes, students will participate in the peer review process by anonymously reviewing a set number of their peers' assignments based on the instructor-defined rubric.
    - **Scenario**: A student wants to submit an assignment.
        - The student logs into the system and navigates to their class.
        - They select the assignment they want to submit.
        - They upload their assignment in the required format and submit it.
        - The system confirms the successful submission of the assignment.
    - **Scenario**: A student wants to review feedback on their assignment.

2. **Instructors:** Instructors will begin by creating/registering their accounts or logging in using their credentials. On initial account creation, the instructor will have a generic student account but, all users will be greeted with a visual prompt asking whether the user is an instructor. This graphical prompt will lead to a form for applying as an instructor (for the system), the instructor will click on the visual prompt to fill out the personalized instructor information form and submit the information to be reviewed by the admin to be granted instructor roles. Once the admin approves the role, instructors will be presented with their personalized class dashboard, where they can view vital information regarding the classes they are hosting. Furthermore, the instructor's dashboard will utilize graphical quick link cards, buttons, prompts, etc, to provide quick access to frequently needed information and also enhance the user experience. The instructor will navigate to a class page to view all currently active classes and will have the option to create a new class.
    - **Scenario**: An instructor wants to create a new class and add assignments.
        - The instructor logs into the system using their credentials.
        - They navigate to the "Create Class" section and fill in the necessary details to create a new class.
        - Once the class is created, they navigate to the "Add Assignment" section within the class.
        - They fill in the assignment details and set a deadline for the assignment.
        - The system confirms the creation of the assignment and adds it to the class.
    - **Scenario**: An instructor wants to monitor student progress.
        - The instructor logs into the system and navigates to the "Dashboard".
        - They select a class to view the progress of the students.
        - The system displays a comprehensive report of student progress and assignment statuses.
3. **Administrators:** An admin user will login via the login portal and will have access to various administrative controls. An admin will be able to oversee transactions of user accounts. Administrators will configure system settings, manage class and assignment storage/data, ensure software maintenance. Admins can review user feedback forms to further maintain and improve the system. 
    - **Scenario**: An administrator wants to manage user accounts.
        - The administrator logs into the system and navigates to the "User Management" section.
        - They can view all user accounts, and have the ability to activate, deactivate, or modify user accounts.
        - They can assign instructor roles for users who submitted an instructor form
    - **Scenario**: An administrator wants to monitor system health.
