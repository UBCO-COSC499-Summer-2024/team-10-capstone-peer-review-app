## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Worked on a lot of items and semi-major features!
* Didn't refactor as many front-end unit tests as I'd wanted (did about 8 out of 22), but I did hold back on refactoring some files as we're yet again going through a major UI overhaul.

## Goals for next cycle
* Testing. Again. Need to do a lot more of it so that we don't do testing later, code first which isn't ideal.
* Get assignments up and running for next cycle, including PDF viewing. File storage is sorted out in a PR that hasn't been merged yet & assignment back-end linking has been done for the most part already.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Making a lot more progress now compared to when I wasn't doing as much 1-2 weeks ago!
* Tests weren't worked on as much as I expected I would. We mostly focused on getting the MVP and the presentation done on-time.
* While I worked on adding functionality, I didn't get to work on ensuring UI consistency in other parts of the app (that I didn't work on in this cycle).

## Goals for next cycle
* Make unit tests for the front-end. Fast.
* Set up integration testing with the help of the team (to figure out how back-end testing was done for instance).
* Ramp up coding since we'd be done with the MVP and its presentation by the end of the class.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* I got a lot more work done which is encouraging! Especially considering this cycle was 5 days long. Would've liked to do a bit more but I'm sort of satisfied.
* Still haven't gotten unit testing fully back up ever since we started linking components up to the back-end and adding new ones.

## Goals for next cycle
* Work on more of the project and make parts of it more consistent. Right now, we're focusing on getting parts done rather than refactoring old components for consistency for the MVP deadline.
* NEED to get unit testing back up and running by the end of Friday at the very least.
* Work on mostly the presentation from mid-Thursday onwards.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Slowly catching up, although not at the pace I wanted to. Running into some holdups with testing elements actually communicating with the backend.
* Starting to link elements to the backend! Linked ManageClass to the backend during this cycle.
* Edit Classes UI was taken up by Mahir so I'm working on other parts (that were assigned to me).
* This cycle was only two days but work should be getting much faster.

## Goals for next cycle
* Get unit testing finally up and running for the components that are now linked to the backend.
* Develop more UI (at a much faster pace) this week-long cycle. We plan to get the MVP done by this cycle (I believe I can push to get my parts done, especially with me having just this to focus on (for the most part)).
* Get (most) of the tests up and running. I'm expecting to not have a 100% of the testing done, but most of it.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* I helped with quite a bit of the PRs that were pushed this cycle, fixing issues, debugging, making sure they work and merging them.
* I didn't do as much this cycle as I wanted to focus on finishing the one other course I was working on this term (and I just did!)

## Goals for next cycle
* I should be able to focus entirely on this project now so I should be able to make up for the time I lost earlier.
* I didn't do Edit Classes UI this cycle but I plan to do it in the next! Shouldn't be too much to do.
* I plan to make more documentation from now on, I already add details and images to my PRs but the code itself needs some documentation too.
* Rewrite tests to accommodate the new UI and the now much-more-clearer objectives on what the code should be doing, making tests more realistic and easier to come up with.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* It's only been 2 days but I couldn't do *too* much as I'd been working on another course. I plan to make up for the missed hours (about 3 hours) this weekend and tomorrow.
* Got list of classes almost done! I added the UI but much of its functionality is UI-based so there is not much to add to it save for an Edit Classes UI (Manage Classes).

## Goals for next cycle
* Need to work on linking more of the other components I worked on with the backend now that the backend is good to go for the most part with PR #115 (which should be merged tmrw).
* Work on and add Edit Classes UI and other smaller components.
* Make components match each other more as there has been a significant UI overhaul on the Dashboard, which now looks great but the other components still need to be touched up to match it.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Got Drone CI & automated unit testing working!
* Added UI for components such as Forgot Password, filtering & searching through a list of classes for the admin.
* Didn't get into integrating more of the front-end with the back-end myself, but I did get to work on testing for the new classes a little and refactoring them.

## Goals for next cycle
* Get the front-end components I worked on recently, at least, to work with the backend and not use the mock data at all.
* Refactor tests as data starts getting processed differently due to shifting away from mock data.
* Work on making website behaviour more consistent, for instance, the popup I used for the List of Classes page uses shadcn's dialog whereas other parts of the website use custom-made modals instead of a shadcn Dialog.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* I feel like we made quite a bit of progress on the UI front! I still need to integrate quite a bit of it with the backend though.
* Testing took a bit to initially setup but adding new test cases (especially those that contain cases for functionality we haven't implemented yet) should be relatively easy.
* Overall, I'm happy with the amount of time & work I did for the project this cycle.

## Goals for next cycle
* Get Drone CI & automated testing working (on Drone CI if it's a thing since GitHub Actions is limited)
* Work on tests to be more comprehensive and include future functionality testing before it's too late.
* Work more on making the front-end elements easily work with the backend and on new features!

## Recap on goals from last cycle
Worked on adding a PDF Viewer but I couldn't really fully complete it considering that we haven't implemented the database yet. Once that's done, I plan to add support for the PDFViewer component to be able to get a PDF using an id, right from the database once we have that up and running. We're having some tech issues with our development environments which is why we're looking into testing dev environments and seeing if they work for us. Seeing as we have dockerization up and running, we may not end up needing it in the end as everyone should have the same environment to develop in.
All in all, I hope to do a lot more work once the database is up and running!

## Goals for next cycle
* Get PDF Viewing working by having it retrieve the PDF doc straight from the database and display it by accepting a document id.
* Develop UI for the assignment creation/submission, and other parts of the project that may not have been done yet.
* Recap the UI work that has been done so far by the other team members just to make sure I'm on the same page as them.
