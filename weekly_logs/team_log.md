## Overall Burn-up Chart of Tasks
Removed all done tasks since the last cycle, burn up looks relatively low because of creation of lots of new tasks. We also have 5 issues that are currenty in review and will be added to the done section in the next cycle.
![Burn-Up Chart for c-11](./team_log_images/burnup_charts/burnup_chart_c11.png)  
  

## Test Reports for c-11

### Front-end Testing for c-11
Tests are not passing since there have been alot of changes to the front end componenets, need to refactor front end tests to accomodate for the changes.

![Front-end Tests for c-11](./team_log_images/front_end_tests/front_end_tests_c11.png)  
  

### Back-end Testing for c-11

Back end tests have been split into unit and intregration tests. Unit tests are mocked and integration tests are not. So far some unit tests are failing due to changes to some of the apiService functions.

#### Unit Tests 
classService currently has too many operations outside of its responsibilities, I.E. rubric operations are still in classService, need to remove them

#### Front-end Testing for c-7
Most front end tests are passing, the ones that are failing are due to changes to login/register and other 
componenets / dashboard, these tests need to be revised to accomodate for the changes in the components. 
Also the location of our mockData has changed and there was some errs from those as well.

For context, On Saturday we reorganized our issues management and milestone management such that each Major Use case became an issue on Saturday. Each milestone (a week) relates to a collection of Use cases we want to complete for the milestone. We also included other more niche issues for things related to the milestone or one of the use-cases.
