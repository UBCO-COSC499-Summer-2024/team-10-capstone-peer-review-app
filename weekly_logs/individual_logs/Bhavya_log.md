## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Worked on creating the CRUD and error testing most of my API endpoints. I didn't want them to just do basic operations but they should also be attentive to the other fields we have set
* Error management and constantly running them to check for mistakes
* Created more connectivity for rubrics and criterion and also added a new Groups table while updating schema

## Goals for next cycle
* I am planning to do little things this next cycle as i have a final exam on Friday, which is why i am planning to finish setting up basic CRUD ops for groups
* If time left, I'll start to do more advanced API endpoints such as get grades for students and get grades for class

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Since the last cycle API endpoints have been developed thoroughly as well as well tested and documented
* DB tests is still in progress and facing some integration issues with it
* Login and auth has been done and tested

## Goals for next cycle
* Complete API endpoints for most of our operations, hopefully 
* Run DB tests successfully 
* Make API endpoints fool proof and secure

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* completed login and authentication for account authentication with Passport.js and Bcrypt.js
* uses Prisma ORM to establish DB connections
* Refactor DB to make it more clean and effective
* Overall DB is going good, needs a little additions here and there but overall speed is good

## Goals for next cycle
* Testing DB
* complete integrating DB with frontend
* testing routes and Node.js functionalities
* Possibly adding new DB queries to make it a wholesome app

Worked on creating the backend setup using PostgreSQL and created a DB design and documentation as well 1 hr

Worked on creating the backend and endpoint requests using Node.js and PostgreSQL - 2.5 hrs

Working on creating the backend setup using Node.js and for all tables

*Completed*

1. Node.js setup is completed and latest version of node and postgres has been uploaded. (Task size - small to medium)

2. API and endpoint request has been up and running which handles most of our DB connections and CRUD operations (task size -large)

*In Progress*

1. Prisma integrations and use with JavaScript is in WIP

2. Authentication for Passport.js and bcrypt.js is almost done just needs few touchups

*Recap on week's goals:*

1. This week was about getting the stuff to move and ready to implement various functionalities. We've been looking into various integrations and setups so as to make coding easier and efficient.

2. I have setup the basic requirements and tested the backend networks for our system

3. Focus was on velocity and getting ready to combine different pieces of features into one

*Next Cycle Goals:*

I aim to finish the authentication parts of the backend using Passport.js and bcrypt.js. I also intend to finish revising on tech like React.js and Redux which we'll be using mostly for frontend. I will also try to give more hours into the development and setting up integrations with Prisma ORM.

**WEEK 1 (May 26 - June 1)**

Worked on creating the project requirements section including UVP to Usage

Worked on creating the sections for the video adding the audio files with the video

Working on database design, creating multiple tables with relationship diagrams. Additionally, working on setting up PostgreSQL so that everyone can work on it.

Creating a template for the tables and the design of our website
