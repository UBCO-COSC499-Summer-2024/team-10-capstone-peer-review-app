# Script for the Video Presentation

## 1. Introduction (Mahir)

Hello, we are team number 10, working on the Peer Review Application. My name is [Name], and I'm joined by my teammates Bhavya Bhagchandani, Abdul Faiz, Josh Farwig, and Mahir Rahman.

Today, we will present the planned key requirements and functionalities of our project.

## 2. Project Purpose and Unique Value Proposition (UVP) (Bhavya)
- "The purpose of our Peer Review Application is to enhance assignment grading through a peer-review system, simplifying workflows for students, instructors, and administrators. Our system aims to provide consistent and reliable feedback from multiple perspectives."
- "Our unique value proposition lies in our intuitive architecture with differentiated user roles, an automated peer review system ensuring fair and anonymous evaluations, and comprehensive progress tracking for both students and instructors."

## 3. Measurable Project Objectives and Success Criteria (Bhavya)
- "Our primary objectives include creating an intuitive, efficient, and secure platform for managing assignments and peer reviews, implementing role-based access control, and streamlining assignment submission and peer-reviewed feedback processes."
- "Success will be measured by effective account creation and authentication services, role-based access control, user-friendly dashboards for monitoring progress and assignment statuses, and robust system security and data privacy measures."

## 4. User Groups and Usage Scenarios (Mahir)
- "Our main user groups are students, instructors, and administrators. Students will use the platform to submit assignments, participate in peer reviews, create groups and participate in group peer reviews, and track their progress."
- "Instructors will create and manage assignments, classes, and groups, oversee peer reviews, and monitor student progress. Administrators will manage user accounts, ensure system security, perform maintenance tasks, and respond to user reports."

Letâ€™s explore how each user group will interact with the system through a few scenarios.

**Students**: Students will create an account or log in to see a personalized dashboard showing class and assignment information. They can submit assignments and participate in peer reviews anonymously. For example, Emily logs in, selects her class, uploads her assignment, and receives a confirmation. Later, she can log in again to view feedback on her submitted work.

**Instructors**: Instructors will create an account, apply for instructor roles, and manage their classes through a personalized dashboard. For instance, Sarah can create a new class, add assignments, set deadlines, and monitor student progress. She logs in, creates a class, adds an assignment, sets the deadline, and receives confirmation. Sarah can also check the progress of her students via her dashboard.

**Administrators**: Administrators will log in to access administrative controls, manage user accounts, and monitor system health. For example, Michael can activate or deactivate user accounts, assign instructor roles, and keep an eye on system performance. For instance, he logs in, navigates to user management, and modifies user accounts as needed and responds to any user reports.

## 5. Requirements

### Functional Requirements (Abdul)

- **User Management**

    - Users must be able to create accounts, log in, and reset passwords securely via a 'Forgot Password' form.
    - Admins must be able to grant instructor permissions.
    - The system must be able to notify all users via email.
 
- **Peer Review Process**

    - Peer reviews are a core part of our system. Instructors must be able to assign peer review assignments to students, ensuring each student reviews a set number of their peers' submissions.
    - To maintain fairness, reviews must be anonymous, and students must be able to submit feedback with the help of the assignment's pre-defined rubric.

- **Progress Monitoring**

    - Progress monitoring is key. We need comprehensive dashboards for both instructors and students to track progress and assignment statuses (i.e. if they're graded or not) effectively.

- **Assignment Management**

    - Instructors must be able to create assignments with associated rubrics, and students must be able to submit their work in various formats.
    - The system should handle deadlines by activating the peer review system for the students when the deadline has been crossed.
    - Plus, there must be mechanisms in place for instructors to provide feedback on student submissions and for students to communicate with instructors regarding their assignments.

- **Group Project Evaluations**

    - Both students and instructors must be able to create and manage groups.
    - Peer reviews within groups must be done anonymously along-with using fairness mechanisms such as the instructor checking peer-reviewed submissions to ensure fairness in grading.

### User Requirements (Abdul)

- **All Users:** All users must be able to create accounts, log in, and reset their password via an easy-to-use interface. They must all also be able to navigate through their assignments and classes, and get notifications via email.

- **Students**: Students will need a user-friendly interface for submitting assignments and receiving feedback from their instructor, participate in anonymous and fair peer evaluations, and have access to their assignment submission history. They also need to be able to fill out a rubric for each peer review they do, and track their own assignment submission statuses (grades).

- **Instructors**: They need a fast, simple, and user-friendly interface for creating classes, assignments, student groups, and rubrics for each assignment they upload. They also need to be able to give feedback to the student as well, and be able to oversee the peer review process. Monitoring and evaluating individual and group performances should be seamless as well.

- **Administrators**: Admins will need administrative functionalities to manage the overall system, user accounts, and configurations, and the ability to respond to user reports efficiently.

### Technical Requirements (Josh)

**Frontend Requirements**

- On the frontend, we'll use a combination of Vite, React, TailwindCSS, Heroicons, and HeadlessUI to create a seamless user experience.
- It's essential to ensure compatibility with major web browsers and responsiveness on mobile devices.

**Backend Requirements**

- For the backend, we'll rely on Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and APIs.
- Our database of choice will be PostgreSQL, and we'll use Drizzle ORM or Prisma ORM for efficient database operations.

**API Development**

- We'll develop RESTful APIs with secure and efficient communication protocols to ensure smooth interactions between the frontend and backend.

**Testing and Deployment**

- To ensure the reliability and stability of our system, we'll implement automated testing using Jest and Cypress.
- Continuous integration with Drone CI or Travis CI will allow us to streamline the deployment process and catch any issues early on.

**Other Libraries and Tools**

- In addition to the core technologies, we'll use Passport.js for authentication and PDF.js for PDF viewing.
- We would also ensure compliance with privacy regulations like the GDPR and FERPA as needed and implement data encryption for security.

## 6. Conclusion (Josh)

- In summary, our Peer Review Application aims to streamline the peer review process, ensuring fairness and providing comprehensive tools for students, instructors, and administrators. Our project is designed to meet the specific needs of each user group, with robust functional and technical requirements to ensure a seamless experience.

- We welcome your feedback and look forward to discussing how our system can best meet your needs. Thank you for your time and attention.
