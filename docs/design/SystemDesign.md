# System Design

## Introduction

In this project, we are developing a user-friendly educational platform designed to streamline the classroom experience for both teachers and students. Our application focuses primarily on the peer-review and assignment management processes, making it easy for teachers to create and manage assignments while enabling students to submit their work and participate in peer reviews. Additionally, the platform includes classroom management features, allowing teachers to organize classes and enroll students. Grading management is also a key aspect, providing tools for teachers to grade assignments efficiently and deliver feedback to students. By providing an integrated tool for these tasks, we aim to enhance the educational process through efficient classroom management, timely notifications, and effective communication between all participants.

**High-Level Usage Scenarios**: 
1. **User Management**: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
2. **Classroom Management**: Create and manage classes, enroll students.
3. **Assignment Management**: Create assignments, track submissions.
4. **Submission Process**: Submit assignments, view submission status.
5. **Review Management**: Conduct peer reviews, provide feedback.
6. **Notification Services**: Receive email and in-app notifications.

## System Architecture Design 

For our project, we will be applying a hybrid of the **Modular Monolith** and **Microservices** architecture patterns. Since we are not sure about the feasabilty or difficulty of a micro-services approach, we are going to start the development process with a standard 3-part architecture: **Front-end service, Back-end service, and a Database**. The Front-end service, or **Client Web Interfaces** will be a React based web-server which will serve front-end content and communicate with the back-end VIA api endpoints. The Back-end service, or the **Core Service Monolith** will provide all of the functionailites of the application and will be seperated into **modules**. These main modules/services are:

* The ***API Gateway / Reverse Proxy*** module...
>    * will facilitate communication between the client (**Front-end service**) and the backend services (**Core Service Monolith**). It will handle routing of requests to the appropriate modules and provide a single entry point for all client requests (may also load balance and rate limit). Additionally, it will manage authentication and authorization by directing these requests to the Authentication module.
* The ***Authentication*** module... 
>    * will manage user login, registration, and authentication processes. It will handle JWT generation and validation (passport.js), ensuring secure access to the application's resources. It will also manage user roles and permissions, providing role-based access control to different parts of the **Core Service Monolith**. 
* The ***Notification*** module...
>    * will be responsible for sending notifications to users. This will include email notifications for account verification, password reset, assignment dead-lines, and review updates. It will interface with an SMTP server or a third-party email service provider to send out these notifications.
* The ***Main*** module... (User, Assignment, and Classroom Operations)
>    * will handle the core instructor and basic user functionalites. This module will manage user profiles, user group assignments, class creation and enrollment, and the creation and management of assignments.
* The ***Submission*** module...
>    * will manage the process of students submitting assignments. This module will handle repeat submissions, various submission formats and restrict submissions to certian file-types. It will also manage the status of submissions and provide feedback to users on their submissions
* The ***Feedback*** module...
>    * will handle the creation and management of feedback on assignment submissions. It will allow reviewers to provide comments and grades on submitted assignments. This module will ensure that feedback is stored and associated with the correct submission and user. 

Since the **Modular Monolith** approach doesn't have to consider isolated inter-service communication, a highly complex API gateway, or other complexities when developing a microservices application, it seems like the best approach to start for development (We can just start developing features on the back-end and begin splitting them into modules). As we continue, if we are making modules quickly, generally isolated, and not extremely overloaded nor complex, we may shift into more of a **Microservices** approach since they favor scalability and also relability (if one of your services goes down, the rest can still run).

### Use Case Diagram

![UML Use Case Diagram](images/use-case-diagram.png)

This Use Case Diagram illustrates an educational platform's functionalities and user interactions. It identifies five user roles: All Users, Unregistered Users, Students, Instructors, and Administrators. All Users can perform basic actions like logging in, viewing courses, and sending reports. Unregistered Users can register to become Students, who can then participate in peer reviews, submit assignments, and request to become Instructors. Instructors manage assignments, peer reviews, classes, and student groups, and can communicate directly with students. Administrators oversee the platform's operation, managing user accounts, reviewing instructor applications, monitoring system health, and configuring system settings. The diagram also shows dependencies between actions, such as how viewing peer review feedback includes participating in peer reviews and sending feedback.

## Database Design 

![db-design](./images/db-diagram.png)

* ***User***: Stores information about users including their role (student, instructor, admin) and associated class.

* ***Class***: Holds details about classes, including the instructor, start and end dates, and class size.

* ***Assignment***: Contains assignment information such as title, description, due date, and evaluation type.

* ***Submission***: Records submissions for assignments, including the student, submission date, feedback, and marks
.
* ***PeerReview***: Captures peer reviews for submissions, including reviewer, review text, date, and rating.

* ***GroupProject***: Details group projects, linking assignments to groups and students.

* ***Group***: Represents groups within projects, linking projects to classes and students.

* ***GroupReview***: Stores reviews of group projects, including reviewer, project, reviewed student, review text, and rating.

* ***Rubric***: Defines rubrics for assignments, including a title and description.

* ***Categories***: Lists categories within rubrics, each with a title, description, and maximum mark.

* ***CategoryMarks***: Records the marks given by students for each category within a submission, linking submissions, categories, and students.

## Data Flow Diagram (Level 0/Level 1)

### Level 0 DFD

Here, we have the Level 0 DFD representing the PeerGrade system! We have the three main user types represented here as well: Students, Instructors, and Administrators. The PeerGrade system acts as the central process, facilitating data flows such as: Students submit assignments, receive feedback, request to join classes, and create groups, while instructors manage assignments, provide feedback, and create classroom and groups. Admins oversee system management, process reports, and upgrade user 

![Level 0 DFD](images/level0dfd.jpg)

### Level 1 DFD

For the Level 1 DFD, Entites stay the same as Student (Default User), Instructor, and Admin. Within the Level 1 DFD there are 8 main processes (Classroom, Authorization, Authentication, Student Assignment, Instructor Assignment, Review, Notification, and System Management). These processes are meant to be similar to the modules of the Modular Monolith design, and can be mappped as such: 

* **Authentication module** = *Authorization and Authentication Process*
* **Notification module** = *Notification and System Management Process*
* **Main module** = *Classroom, User, and Instructor Assignment Process*
* **Submission module** = *Student Assignment Process*
* **Feedback module** = *Review Process*

# PeerGrade Wireframes:
* Our client has expressed that only desktop views are required for this project therefore, no mobile views have been created.
  
## Login UI
* A nice-to-have feature - CWL type login to use and enter the platform however, the bare minimum will provide an authenticated login service with user differentiation of student/instructor/admin.

## Dashboard UI
* The Dashboard page is the first page accessed after a successful user login. It facilitates easy access to active classes and upcoming assignments with further navigation hosted on the navbar.
