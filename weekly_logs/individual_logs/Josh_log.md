## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Finally got our docker development enviroment all setup! There was some issues with prisma before and also
  all file-watching functionalities stopped working in our previous edition for the first mini presentation,
  but is all handlded now. The frontend and backend has file watching now, including database resets when changes are seen
  in the prisma.schema file 
* For this cycle, Bhavya took on doing the instructor API endpoints so I shifted my focus to created verify email, confirm email, forgot password, and reset password routes.
  They use JWT's so it took a little bit to learn how they work but so far its all up and running on the routes! Just need to integrate validation and testing into them now. 
* I also created some basic role based access middleware so that certian users won't have the permission to access protected routes

## Goals for next cycle
* Create an ecompassing errorHandling middleware so error handing is unified and more organizied in routes
* Add JOI validation to auth routes
* Integrate UI with Verification / Login / Regsiter routes
* Create a seperate dockerized isolated testing enviroment for the back-end and integrate into droneCI
* Start working on how role-requests will look and be modeled

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Last cycle I was hoping to get most of the basic api-endpoints setup along with 
some login / register and authentication features running, although I was able to get this set up, it breaks with the UI and we need to spend this weekend sifting through it to get everything working. On the bright side, express essions and cookies work and user data can be stored in cookies
* I wanted to create endpoints for class creation, assignment creation, rubric creation / middleware for role based access however wasn't able to get to it due to issues with setting up
Prisma in a docker-network
* Going forward I need to look into how to set up prisma in a docker network, and how to reference other containers on the network, look into why some containers can't be accessed by their container_name

## Goals for next cycle
* Refactor UI and integrate with api so that after a user logs into the dashboard it doesn't break
* Refactor Docker network to work with Prisma
* Create basic endpoints for instructor operations i.e. class creation, assignment creation, read all assignments etc. 
* Create some basic role-based access middle-ware
