Worked on creating the backend setup using PostgreSQL and created a DB design and documentation as well 1 hr

Worked on creating the backend and endpoint requests using Node.js and PostgreSQL - 2.5 hrs

Working on creating the backend setup using Node.js and for all tables

*Completed*

1. Node.js setup is completed and latest version of node and postgres has been uploaded. (Task size - small to medium)

2. API and endpoint request has been up and running which handles most of our DB connections and CRUD operations (task size -large)

*In Progress*

1. Prisma integrations and use with JavaScript is in WIP

2. Authentication for Passport.js and bcrypt.js is almost done just needs few touchups

*Recap on week's goals:*

1. This week was about getting the stuff to move and ready to implement various functionalities. We've been looking into various integrations and setups so as to make coding easier and efficient.

2. I have setup the basic requirements and tested the backend networks for our system

3. Focus was on velocity and getting ready to combine different pieces of features into one

*Next Cycle Goals:*

I aim to finish the authentication parts of the backend using Passport.js and bcrypt.js. I also intend to finish revising on tech like React.js and Redux which we'll be using mostly for frontend. I will also try to give more hours into the development and setting up integrations with Prisma ORM.

**WEEK 1 (May 26 - June 1)**

Worked on creating the project requirements section including UVP to Usage

Worked on creating the sections for the video adding the audio files with the video

Working on database design, creating multiple tables with relationship diagrams. Additionally, working on setting up PostgreSQL so that everyone can work on it.
