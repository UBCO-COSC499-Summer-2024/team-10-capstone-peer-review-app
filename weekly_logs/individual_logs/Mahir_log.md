### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
On Friday, After our team meeting, I decided I wanted to continue my work from the previous night (I was on a roll!) and decided to challenge myself to get the major UI pages up and running to make them available for our design video presentation. I completed a variety of component-related issues (issue numbers). After finishing the UI components, I collected video requirement parts from each individual on our team and started editing and compiling our video file for submission. This took a lot longer than I was expecting because there was a little team miscommunication that led to delays in retrieving everyone's video. Also after putting it all together, the video was too long for our submission requirement. I tried to cut out or speed up parts where I could and submitted a little while before the submission portal closed. After submitting, I realized a chunk from our use-case diagram portion had cut off and been skipped over which was unfortunate. I quickly emailed Scott explaining the situation in hope our full corrected attempt would be accepted. 

Since Friday was a big chunk of work done, I decided to take it lightly the next 2 days and picked up the pace from Monday. My major focuses are on the issues that are currently in progress.

### Next Cycle Goals to achieve for Wed(06/12) -> Friday(06/14): 
  * Finish user-differentiated login paired with the database.
  * Assignment creation/management on instructor role accounts
  * Instructor creates/manages classes on a manageClass page UI.
  * (Reach goal) - Assignments are properly viewable/downloadable depending on students who have access to the class.
