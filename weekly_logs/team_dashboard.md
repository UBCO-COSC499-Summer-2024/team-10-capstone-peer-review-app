### Major features to work on for c-8
*  Major Use Cases 4, 14, 15, 17, 18: Class CRUD Api endpoints / UI 
    * UI and Api endpoints have been created, we now need to finish other front-end api calls and refactor our organization to decouple api logic from components. Also, need to integrate redux persistence. 
  
*  Major Use Case 10: Role Requests / Admin UI for accepting and denying role requests
  

### Team Issues and Hurdles for c-7
*  Josh was traveling between Nanaimao to see friends from June 21st to June 24 so we were down a member for a bit

* Other members also had Finals or were finishing up other classes so attention to the project was slighly deferred 
  
*  There are still some existing UI integrations that need to be done, also we realized there is no session management in the front-end so when the page is manually refreshed no components render, so we need to tweak this as well.

* Major Use Case 10: Role Requests / Admin UI for accepting and denying role requests
  

### Team Issues and Hurdles for c-5
*  Honestly largest issue you could say is that we are like 75% done on most of these major use cases,
   we just neeed to integrate the backend and our UI together. I know mahir already started making an API calls
   folder so we just need to set-up the calls in our front-end to make everything unified
  
* Also, we need to think about how to do dynamic page-redirects for auth related things, I believe we can do this redux
  But we don't know yet if that would be a security concern moving forward.
