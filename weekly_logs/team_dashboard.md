### Team Issues and Hurdles for c-5
*  Honestly largest issue you could say is that we are like 75% done on most of these major use cases,
   we just neeed to integrate the backend and our UI together. I know mahir already started making an API calls
   folder so we just need to set-up the calls in our front-end to make everything unified
  
* Also, we need to think about how to do dynamic page-redirects for auth related things, I believe we can do this redux
  But we don't know yet if that would be a security concern moving forward.
