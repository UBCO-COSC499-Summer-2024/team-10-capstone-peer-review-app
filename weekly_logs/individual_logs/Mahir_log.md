## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Josh and I spent today figuring out the bugs on Peer Review UI and the student grading UI
* Group review will need to wait because we want to make sure student peer review is working properly
* Besides group reviews, I spent time fixing bugs and issues that arose from our testing workshop last Friday.
* I had a super slow week in terms of work. I took many days off to get a break from the project but struggled to return to my previous pace. In the last 2 days of the cycle, I started to get back on pace and am now looking forward to a consistent 2 weeks to finish this project off.

## Goals for next cycle
* Josh Abdul and I have made a game plan to finish up all the review UI and logic which I am hoping to finish up with them
* Once group reviews are complete, our main features for the app will be completed 
* The end of the cycle will be focused on fixing bugs and potentially implementing any reach goals if there is enough time to implement them.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* This was probably the hardest week of the project for me but, the work has definitely paid off.
* My cycle started off with finishing up little things with the student Assignment submission UI. This was one of the big use cases to deal with so I was happy to finish that faster than I expected. The next big challenge was grading a submission and viewing grades for a submission
* Grading a submission was a big load to take on which I wasn't quite expecting at first. I had initially got it up and running within a day but that was only for the instructor to grade and be able to view the grades however, I quickly realized how unorganized my logic was so I needed to sit down and think about how API calls should be structured to make my job on the UI side a bit easier. My initial process was making 4 different fetch calls and mashing all the information together however after having a couple of meetings with Josh, we realized if I nest each object within each other from the API calls itself, then it makes the fetch and displaying process on the UI much easier. Nevertheless, this was still quite a handful to do hence the many hours it took to set up and get going. 
* By the end of Monday night, I was able to get the instructor Submissions.jsx page refactored with the new logic we implemented and got it up and running again and then the next task was to create the ability to assign and de-select reviewers (peer reviewers/students in the class) so that they can grade the student submission as well.
* After the assignment for reviewers finished up, I started work on the peer review page on our navbar. I refactored the UI so that one tab is for submissions I am waiting to get graded from instructors or students and the other tab is for reviews that I have pending which need to be completed for other students. I was able to get the views of the grades that are received from instructors and other students up and running however, I still have the portion left where I need to create the UI so that the student reviewer can see and mark the submission of their grading.

## Goals for next cycle
* Finish up all the logic and UI behind students marking reviews and viewing reviews
* Go back through all the things I implemented and make sure that all cases of CRUD ops are implemented (in some places I forgot to implement a delete function, for example, if a review is created, you can only update it but you can't delete it at all which isn't ideal-- there are other smaller things similar to this all over the Class.jsx page)
* The next big task would be to figure out group assignments. I believe after that, we will be super close to the finish line of this project if not for unforeseeable events.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* I was able to get the Assignment submission for students done and also the instructor view for assignment submission. All that is left is to merge the new changes into dev!
* I had a big rework design which was most of my day on Wednesday and Wednesday night as well.
* There is a slight problem with the db that only allows for a single student to be in a class. We definitely need to get on top of that if we want the application to be flowing properly.
* Overall, the pace is still good I would say. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Merge remaining approved pull requests and get the design update integrated
* Work on assignment submission view/download feature
* Start implementing instructor grading submission and a peer review grade submission

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* My cycle started off by focusing on the assignment upload and file storage implementation. Most of Friday night  was spent figuring out the bugs and linking all the APIs properly (from fresh because the last version had some annoying bugs).
* The next major task was to set up our rubric uploads for each assignment. The UI needed work so the next day or so, I updated the UI and successfully enabled rubric upload and linked new rubrics with selected assignments. 
* For the latter half of Sunday and most of Monday I spent working on making more changes to the class assignment/rubric features so that there would be refreshed assignment views and rubric views whenever you upload a new one (to see changes immediately) and a few more design tweaks to help facilitate other processes (a files tab was generated to view all assignment uploads).
* I had read the comments of our design feedback and our presentation feedback and realized we really need to update our design to be more "canvas" like. I worked on a UI refactor branch to update the views of the navbar and a fix a few ui bugs that were persisting and was able to bring it a little closer to the the preferred design. 
* I revisited the file storage architecture and spent a good while researching how to facilitate a cloud storage environment to save us from putting a heavy load on our database. Then, I figured it was best to set up a Nginx docker container for file uploads and after a few attempts, I was successful in creating this container and facilitating file uploads to the localhost:8080 port. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Using localhost:8080 to retrieve the stored assignment files and link to the current view assignment page
* Create a separate submission page consisting of rubric details so that students can submit assignments 
* Setting up assignment submissions with the API's and rubric submissions for peer review with the APi links as well
* Adding tooltips and hints throughout the app for a better user experience. 

Reflection over the last week: 
* I feel like I have picked up the pace recently for my development toward the project and also feeling like I am on a roll with a few things. I hope this streak keeps going for me till the end because we do still have quite a bit left to do and I worry that we may fall behind if we are not on top of things as we go. I have a lot more ideas and features I wanted to get to but given our current status, it may be difficult to achieve any reach goals.
* I think a good idea for us as a team may be to do more in-person group meetups where all 4 of us can work on things together for a good while. Josh Abdul and I frequently meet on call to have work sessions together and I noticed that although we may not always work on the same thing together, having a different perspective around always helps me out in the development.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* The assignment was able to be properly linked to view the information on both the view tabs and the edit tabs however, the edit tab doesn't yet update the newly inputted information to the actual db  (only fetches the currently existing information)
* I had to think out and work exactly how the rubric system would be implemented and I attempted to make a rubricApi.js file (on the client side) that facilitates the requirements for submitting a rubric. I had to also edit the UI in order to match up with a similar layout/style to a message Parsa shared through Slack which was helpful. After setting it up, I failed to actually get it working where the rubric submits properly (a whole lot of debugging left to do to make it work properly...)
* Uploading an assignment feature works but I've run into a really annoying problem on the client side that's preventing me from gathering and sending any form data to my API call. I was however, successful in getting everything else in assignment upload functioning (e.g API calls were successful, adding to the db/class and fetching current category info + updating info were all successful) but for some reason, the submit button on the form refuses to work and I spent my entire flight coming back from Toronto testing + trying to figure that out and failed...
* I also tried working on local upload and file storage however, this will take a lot more time to fully finalize as we need to make some team decisions regarding how this should be structured. I decided to leave it out as a part of the assignment upload (just wanted to get the basic upload information working first and tackle file uploading after the 50% MVP).
* I wish I focused on this whole process in the opposite manner of how I went at it. Meaning, that I should have started off trying to upload the basic assignment details and then worked on the rubric and file upload... I spent the majority of the time on the latter two and if I hadn't, perhaps we could've had something up and running for the 50% MVP.

## Goals for next cycle
* Figure out Assignment upload client-side bugs
* Rework and also figure out rubric upload along with assignment upload
* Also have a team talk about structuring and implementing how file storage will work for our application when uploading an assignment and editing assignment files.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* For this cycle the main focus was on refactoring redux to be removed and implementing Josh's new context API functions wherever needed and I believe that was accomplished. 
* The next major work relied on linking the backend to the UI and Josh, Abdul, and I had spent a few days working continuously on a refactoring branch (181) to get the initial refactoring and linking done to get our dashboards and Class pages up and running
* We still have the Assignment and Peer review side of things pending however we had a team meeting last night to discuss our tasks and are all similarly working on a new branch together (183) to get the second remaining portion of all Api links done.
* Some backend Api calls may need to be refactored as we will have to change the Prisma schema to add information that is currently missing.

## Goals for next cycle
* For the next cycle, my goal is to finish linking up the Assignment portion to the backend, I currently have editing and uploading an assignment left (viewing works at the moment) and I also need to figure out how file storage will be implemented. 
* After that, another priority is to make sure our presentation for the 50% MVP is good to go, most of Thursday's focus will be on this
* If we get the time, I will also try to implement the Peer-Review side of our app however, this is a big task in itself so I've also asked Abdul to help me out after I get the assignment upload parts done.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* The last day of 2 we had a team meeting to discuss our use of redux. After further talks with the team, we decided its best to switch our redux implementation to now use Reacts context API instead. My goals thus changed from redux implementation to now focus more on how Context API works 
* I spent thursday to remove all the redux logic and research the new implementation . Then I handed the branch off to Josh for further Context API development  
* I am now working on any of the issues on UI that need to be prepared for the linking of the rest of our API calls

## Goals for next cycle
* Creae Assignment related api calls for managing assignments 
* Finish any pending UI components 
* Make sure project 50% MVP is ready to go by Wednesday

*** Important note: Clockify cycles were a bit miscalculated, I had a bunch of hours throughout Thursday night/Friday morning but that wasn't captured through the automated logs. Attaching a photo to add to that: 
![clockify Thursday missed hours](https://github.com/UBCO-COSC499-Summer-2024/team-10-capstone-peer-review-app/assets/67985978/eb4b8e94-f32b-4d61-9857-aabf3b4ed0a2)

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* I finished the seeding logic and our db now seeds mock data on generation. Prisma allows a simple seed file to be created that runs mock data generation calls and I also used a package called faker to quickly create mock data for our needs. 
* I finished the UserController setup: This took me a good while, I spent a day and a bit figuring out everything structure-wise on the back end after Josh and I had planned out a new architecture. He set it up quite perfectly and once I got the idea behind his setup, the controllers/services/routes didn't take much longer to set up and get going. I was also introduced to using the Thundercat extension on vsCode, which made me happy because testing the database calls before the implementation was a sweet tip to ensure compatibility.
* After implementing the backend API calls, I was successful in pairing it up with our initial files on the client side. Specifically, I linked the dashboard and navbar to now be associated with the db-generated seed data. I set up a student, instructor, and admin account to test all roles whenever needed.
* I focused on the Admin Dashboard UI and finished it as a functional rough draft. Whenever the adminController is made, it is now ready to be linked as soon as the API calls are generated. 
* I created the notifications UI (how notifications look/are dealt with) within our avatar (navbar -> avatar (on hover:) and the notifications pop up on hover along with the logout button as well. 

## Goals for next cycle
* My next task is to link Bhavya's instructor/class API calls he made to our main Class UI and the sub-pages hosted within the class UI as well. 
* After getting all the UI linked to their respective API calls, I can finally work on organizing the redux structure. I could work on it now however, our MVP deadline is coming up and I want to focus on major tasks to achieve before handling structural benefits. 
* If I have time, I will continue to work on design updates similar to my previous shadCN design update branch (155) I implemented last week. I thoroughly enjoy this part of programming but I know it's not a priority so it holds the least amount of priority at the moment.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* I finished the design updates which was a good upgrade in terms of visual organisation and utilization of shadCN components
* API calls were restructured due to a conversation josh and I had of how we were handling our arhchitecture. Upon further suggestinos and research over meetings, josh set up the new framework of our server architecture
* After getting clear on what the architecture will be, i joined in on coding the api calls in the new structure and started the implementation process of userControllers and Services
* I added a seeding process to create mock data in our prismaDB so that we can test to see if our app is pulling data correctly on various pages. Currently, data seeding is working and runs with docker however the API fetch calls are being annoying.

## Goals for next cycle
* Finish user controller/user service to host all necessary user-related actions within the system
* Finalize a good seed file so that it works well to view data properly
* Create the adminController
* finish the Admin Dashboard UI

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Redux implementation was planned out but not implemented
* Josh and I were meant to finish the API links to UI however, the backend API calls were still in progress, therefore, we decided to wait for that to be done
* Client-side API call structure was planned to change and implemented for login/register (for now)
* Minor UI updates (Toaster msg, Avatars, Buttons) were handled to enhance UX
* ShadCN has more capabilities to improve our app user experience and can bring more code organization, so I started working on each page to refactor to utilize components better.
* Started to create the Admin Dashboard UI
* Got a good start on documentation of all components created

## Goals for next cycle
* Finish documenting everything.
* Finish the Admin Dashboard UI (with authenticated service) and Role approval system (Instructor approval).
* Implement the shadCN changes.
* Finish linking the backend API calls to the UI.
* Build the habit of testing -> developing, rather than the other way.
  
## Reflection
* For this cycle, my personal focus was more towards planning and organizing the next few steps to take. Over the weekend, we had a few calls as a team and individually to discuss the overall structure of how we want the UI and the backend to communicate as well as talking through exactly what that may look like. I also took the time to plan out the Redux structure and decided what reducers to create to better facilitate our needs. On top of that, I spent time discussing all the features we want up and running for our next milestone and started rough drafts on any new UI structures. I didn't spend too much time coding this cycle because all my major tasks relied on the backend API calls working. At first, I attempted to do them myself but quickly realized Bhavya was in charge of that so I decided to wait for him to finish his changes rather than making another "mock" linking of the application processes. I think he finished last night and Josh and I discussed that we will be spending the day completing the API linking today/tonight.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Redux was implemented however, since the DB linking has not been completed, I decided not to go extensive with more redux development
* I was able to fix many of the major design bugs and implemented minor design upgrades throughout the entire UI
* Prisma linking to the UI has been a nightmare. Josh and I spent the entire night until class presentation time to get this running. Our login authentication worked but we still have a lot more linking logic to get the other services up and running. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Finish linking the database to the UI
* Create more redux slices/states for easier data retrieval (on the client side) 
* Implement assignment creation, class creation, and peer-review features.
* Catch up on documentation on all components and middleware implemented.
* I will focus on code organization and design upgrades if I have more time than expected.

## Reflection: 
* The last 2 days we had to deal with a mountain load of bugs. Prisma ORM was more challenging to deal with than we expected however Josh put in countless hours to debug the backend problems and after that, both Josh and I spent the entire night integrating the UI with the backend, and it is safe to say that we had a roller coaster of a night... I'm super happy because, with an hour left before our presentations, we finally got the major functions up and running (for the most part). Josh and I have agreed to get the rest of the API fetch integrations up and running within the next few days.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* On the last cycle, I created a bunch of the initial components and made sure the flow of the application was working so that we could use it to demonstrate our UI in the design video requirement
* Successfully emulated DB design for mock data processes to ensure an efficient transfer once database is up and running.
* To manage session state, I talked with our group and suggested the use of React-redux as it allows for easy session state storage and management.
* The major tasks included the creation of UI components, the transfer of UI data to the emulated dbData (mock data), and Redux state management to store user login state and use state to differentiate data within the program.
* I also spent some time fixing design bugs (CIP)

## Goals for next cycle
* Our initial wireframe has design bugs/inconsistencies, I would want to spend a good amount of time fixing those bugs to have a uniform look.
* Code cleanup and code documentation will be a big focus to bring some organization toward the work I've done so far
* Replacing mock data processes with database schema and making sure Prisma ORM is correctly integrated.
* Creating Instructor class management UI  and reviewing and integrating Abdul's Instructor Create assignment UI with the new Redux implementations

  
### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
On Friday, After our team meeting, I decided I wanted to continue my work from the previous night (I was on a roll!) and decided to challenge myself to get the major UI pages up and running to make them available for our design video presentation. I completed a variety of component-related issues (issue numbers). After finishing the UI components, I collected video requirement parts from each individual on our team and started editing and compiling our video file for submission. This took a lot longer than I was expecting because there was a little team miscommunication that led to delays in retrieving everyone's video. Also after putting it all together, the video was too long for our submission requirement. I tried to cut out or speed up parts where I could and submitted a little while before the submission portal closed. After submitting, I realized a chunk from our use-case diagram portion had cut off and been skipped over which was unfortunate. I quickly emailed Scott explaining the situation in hope our full corrected attempt would be accepted. 

Since Friday was a big chunk of work done, I decided to take it lightly the next 2 days and picked up the pace from Monday. During the end of this cycle, I focused mainly on implementing a proper database-like system that emulates the database design we created, after I focused on setting up Redux and successfully emulated user-differentiated login and the user session management to show user-differentiated data within the app. I got Redux working perfectly (for now) and was really happy with how the system flow works in terms of UI.

- (Dashboard component) After the skeleton was finished, I started creating a rough outline of the dashboard UI and got shadCN to work properly (had to read through a lot of documentation for setting up)
