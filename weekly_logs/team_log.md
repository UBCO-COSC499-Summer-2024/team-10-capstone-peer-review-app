## Overall Burn-up Chart of Tasks
For context, On Saturday we reorganized our issues management and milestone management such that each Major Use case became an issue on Saturday. Each milestone (a week) relates to a collection of Use cases we want to complete for the milestone. We also included other more niche issues for things related to the milestone or one of the use-cases.
