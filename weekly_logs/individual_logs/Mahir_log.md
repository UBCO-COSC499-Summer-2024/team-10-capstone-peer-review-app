## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Redux was implemented however, since the db linking has not been completed, I decided not to go extensive with more redux development
* I was able to fix many of the major design bugs and implemented minor design upgrades throughout the entire UI
* Prisma linking to the UI has been a nightmare. Josh and I spent the entire night up until class presentation time in order to get this running. Our login authentication worked but we still have a lot more linking logic to get the other services up and running. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Finish linking the database to the UI
* Create more redux slices/states for easier data retrieval (on the client side) 
* Implement assignment creation, class creation, and peer-review features.
* Catch up on documentation on all components and middleware implemented.
* I will focus on code organization and design upgrades if I have more time than expected.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* On the last cycle, I created a bunch of the initial components and made sure the flow of the application was working so that we could use it to demonstrate our UI in the design video requirement
* Successfully emulated DB design for mock data processes to ensure an efficient transfer once database is up and running.
* To manage session state, I talked with our group and suggested the use of React-redux as it allows for easy session state storage and management.
* The major tasks included the creation of UI components, the transfer of UI data to the emulated dbData (mock data), and Redux state management to store user login state and use state to differentiate data within the program.
* I also spent some time fixing design bugs (CIP)

## Goals for next cycle
* Our initial wireframe has design bugs/inconsistencies, I would want to spend a good amount of time fixing those bugs to have a uniform look.
* Code cleanup and code documentation will be a big focus to bring some organization toward the work I've done so far
* Replacing mock data processes with database schema and making sure Prisma ORM is correctly integrated.
* Creating Instructor class management UI  and reviewing and integrating Abdul's Instructor Create assignment UI with the new Redux implementations

  
### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
On Friday, After our team meeting, I decided I wanted to continue my work from the previous night (I was on a roll!) and decided to challenge myself to get the major UI pages up and running to make them available for our design video presentation. I completed a variety of component-related issues (issue numbers). After finishing the UI components, I collected video requirement parts from each individual on our team and started editing and compiling our video file for submission. This took a lot longer than I was expecting because there was a little team miscommunication that led to delays in retrieving everyone's video. Also after putting it all together, the video was too long for our submission requirement. I tried to cut out or speed up parts where I could and submitted a little while before the submission portal closed. After submitting, I realized a chunk from our use-case diagram portion had cut off and been skipped over which was unfortunate. I quickly emailed Scott explaining the situation in hope our full corrected attempt would be accepted. 

Since Friday was a big chunk of work done, I decided to take it lightly the next 2 days and picked up the pace from Monday. During the end of this cycle, I focused mainly on implementing a proper database-like system that emulates the database design we created, after I focused on setting up Redux and successfully emulated user-differentiated login and the user session management to show user-differentiated data within the app. I got Redux working perfectly (for now) and was really happy with how the system flow works in terms of UI.

- (App skeleton ticket) Got the vite app skeleton up (blank starting navigation pages created) and completed a demo login page that directs a blank dashboard with a navbar that works.
    - ![image](https://github.com/UBCO-COSC499-Summer-2024/team-10-capstone-peer-review-app/assets/67985978/8521b5b0-75d8-49c1-b45c-5c103430f834)
- (Dashboard component) After the skeleton was finished, I started creating a rough outline of the dashboard UI and got shadCN to work properly (had to read through a lot of documentation for setting up)

June 1-5th: 
- mainly worked on Figma UI for our design document and also component interactions to show potential user experience flows for the design video requirement
- interaction of components ticket also included a lot of small UI edits and around 20mins of tutorials on interaction flows on Figma
