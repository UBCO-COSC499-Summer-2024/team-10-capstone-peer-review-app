## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Based on my goals from last cycle I was really only able to complete the PR-215 for route wrapper components, It works with based on the user Context but it isnt working with session expiration, so I am going to ask kevin for some help with it, I've spent way too much time on this and need to get other things done 

## Goals for next cycle
* Assist with Merging PR's and conflicts
* Set up some more integration tests for the backend
* Complete CSV group uploads / student enroll uploads 
* Assis with setting functionalities of PeerReviews

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Based on goals from last cycle, I was able to fix classes navbar state changes by creating a new class context, and adding a hook to the class context to update the navbar state when a new class is added, mahir and abdul helped by also adding in the hooks in the other components that needed to usethe context.
* I started to work on the forgot password token clear, was getting some issues and abdul was able to help me with it and he got it work. 
* I have a dockerized testing enviroment for integration tests, I was able to get it working with the some service tests, and a controller test, I was getting some issues with the ports but I think its because of how I am using ENV vars in my docker-compose file, my other files
* I started working on cleaning up permissions / session state things for the front-end, such as protecting our roles VIA a route wrapper for role-based access and permissions issue. I also wanted to make it so that if the user has a valid session, if they acess the login page, they are redirected to the dashboard. Mahir made some mahir UI changes that haven't been merged to dev yet though and if was forked off of an older branch so I may end up just restarting to not deal with bad merge conflicts. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Complete PR-214, for route wrapper etc. 
* Finish up some more tests for the integration tests, get merged into dev. 
* Start helping mahir with the ngnix upload service, try to get it working to also download files from the server too.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* In terms of goals from last cycle, I wanted to finish linking Role Requests to the UI and in general help out with other api endpoint links
* I was able to finish role-requests, I was having some issues lifting state and learning some React concepts on state techniques but I eventually got it all set-up (To approve, deny, set to pending, cancel, and delete)
* I was also debugging other smaller issues that popped up with new implementations and older ones, I.E. verify email not clearing the JWT token in the URL, as well as the search bar not filtering people in the people tabs. 
* I spent a fair amount of time setting up the slides with abdul as well for the presentation. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Fix Classes navbar state, since I noticted that wasnt refreshing state when a new class is added.  
* Fix forgot password to clear the URL when a JWT is found in the URL, also revamp the checkEmail functionality. 
* Set up a dockerized testing enviroment for integration tests, rather than just doing our isolated unit tests for the backend.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* In terms of goals from Last cycle, Mahir, Abdul, and I were all able to refactor and create alot of the api-calls done on the front-end. We are in the process still of refactoring and adding new api-endpoints and are working to link together new things such as Edit assignment, create assignment => Which also entails creating a rubric, and so on
* I was able to create a userContext hook that now replaces the old redux selector and slice, It is still a tad buggy its use effect needs to be refactored to not try to fetch user data on a non-user page I.E login
* I started to work on the role-requests on Monday to link with the front-end but there was alot of other things to work on for the admin page so I got side-tracked by that and worked on refactoring how some of the admin navbars appear, Going to get role-request approvals / user view for instructors up and running by tomorrow! 

## Goals for next cycle
* Link Role requests to Front-end
* Continue creating / refactoring admin page 
* Help with other Main features, geared more towards Assignment, Submission, and Rubric

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* In terms of goals from last cycle, I was able to complete the roleRequest model with prisma services, api controllers, and api routes. I also added some extra
  mock tests in the authService tests to test the database operations and errors. 
* Mahir and I were discussing the use-cases of redux and its complexities and learning curve since none of us have really used it extensively, so Mahir decided it was
  probably a better idea to ditch it. This set back a bit in work since I was drafting ideas to deal with session storage / userId global state storage. React has a hook for this
  kind of global state so I am going to work in this today (Friday June 28th) and hopefully have it all set-up and working.
* I haven't started reorganizing the api calls on the front-end so I would like to get to that either later today or tomorrow depending on how long setting up session storage / user Context takes
* I am honestly a little concerned on our progress in the last week, I know its been harder to get some things done due to Finals occuring for our team-mates so I hope we get around 45% of our features in
  by Wednesday. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Set up user context / session management on the front-end
* Re-organize / refactor api calls on the front-end. 
* Complete other ui / api integrations, Ideally link up the role-requests to work as well with admins.

# SIDENOTE: 
#### All times from Thursday 5PM to Friday 5PM were not shown on the clockify entry for this cycle due to a bug, just hotfixed it but depending on the person, there may of been alot of work completed in these hours

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Last cycle I was hoping to start working with the groups model as well as some of the ui integrations,
  Since I was on vacation on the island for the weekend and didnt't get back till late last night I wasn't able to complete much this cycle.
* My main focus was figuring out how to do some of the testing for the backend, and I looked into prisma's documentation on how they identify doing
  Unit testing, they ended up using jest mocking so I spent a fair amount of time looking into that for testing. So far I have our authService tested with mocks
  but I am looking into how to do integration testing for our controllers and routers.
* I also spent some time doing some small things like .env changes

## Goals for next cycle
* Integrate session management into Redux authSlices, add redux-persist to persist userSlices
* Organize Front-end api calls / redux calls 
* Start working on a requests model and api endpoints for role requests, refactor register to create a request
  if the role type is instructor or admin.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* This cycle I really wasn't able to get as much done as I wanted as I was packing for leaving to vancouver island on thursday and left today on Friday, so I was really only able to get some work done after class on wednesday and a little bit yesterday and today. 
* Last cycle I mainly wanted to get a testing enviroment setup as well as begin to incorperate UI and backend functionalities so we could mark off our major use case milestones. I ended up mainly refactoring how we structured our API so that it followed more of a Clean Architecture approach. I added a readME in the src folder of server explaining what the differenations are. 

## Goals for next cycle
* Complete UI integrations with backend
* Set up Groups in the database as well as a Request model for role requests
* Create more routes for based on model types.

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Finally got our docker development enviroment all setup! There was some issues with prisma before and also
  all file-watching functionalities stopped working in our previous edition for the first mini presentation,
  but is all handlded now. The frontend and backend has file watching now, including database resets when changes are seen
  in the prisma.schema file 
* For this cycle, Bhavya took on doing the instructor API endpoints so I shifted my focus to created verify email, confirm email, forgot password, and reset password routes.
  They use JWT's so it took a little bit to learn how they work but so far its all up and running on the routes! Just need to integrate validation and testing into them now. 
* I also created some basic role based access middleware so that certian users won't have the permission to access protected routes

## Goals for next cycle
* Create an ecompassing errorHandling middleware so error handing is unified and more organizied in routes
* Add JOI validation to auth routes
* Integrate UI with Verification / Login / Regsiter routes
* Create a seperate dockerized isolated testing enviroment for the back-end and integrate into droneCI
* Start working on how role-requests will look and be modeled

&nbsp; &nbsp; :orange_circle: **Issue-[16](https://github.com/UBCO-COSC499-Summer-2024/team-10-capstone-peer-review-app/issues/16)**: Create Automated Weekly Log Workflow   
  

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Last cycle I was hoping to get most of the basic api-endpoints setup along with 
some login / register and authentication features running, although I was able to get this set up, it breaks with the UI and we need to spend this weekend sifting through it to get everything working. On the bright side, express essions and cookies work and user data can be stored in cookies
* I wanted to create endpoints for class creation, assignment creation, rubric creation / middleware for role based access however wasn't able to get to it due to issues with setting up
Prisma in a docker-network
* Going forward I need to look into how to set up prisma in a docker network, and how to reference other containers on the network, look into why some containers can't be accessed by their container_name

## Goals for next cycle
* Refactor UI and integrate with api so that after a user logs into the dashboard it doesn't break
* Refactor Docker network to work with Prisma
* Create basic endpoints for instructor operations i.e. class creation, assignment creation, read all assignments etc. 
* Create some basic role-based access middle-ware
