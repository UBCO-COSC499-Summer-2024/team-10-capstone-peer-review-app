## Goals for next cycle
* Working on testing the backend more and more
* Work on documentations for services
* Prepare for live demos and presentations

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Completed additional routes for the review table so that the frontend can have more features such as review histoty, submission criteria and individual + peer grades
* Started looking into testing older api routes created and jot down the tests required
* Submit routes are good for now, might add new routes later
## Goals for next cycle
* Complete all routes for reviews and submit and test them with with a mock setup of local data of classes, students and instructors
* write tests for the routes
* write new functionalities if needed for the routes, especially review ones as it is a vast field

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Add more routes with more functions between our tables and modified our schema to make it look more robust and logical. Also, completed the major CRUD review and grading routes which is now more robust than before. Therefore from the backend perspective, our Peer Review functionality is done!
* Added more fields and functionalities in our schema (to make their flow logical). We had some inconsistencies in Review table and assignments table which I fixed.
* Tested our backend services manually but now working on writing tests on jest

## Goals for next cycle
* Complete additional routes for the review table so that the frontend can have more features.
* Start with testing older api routes created
* Look for adding more routes if needed in the submit routes

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Worked on initiating testing env jest and supertest and research into them to be able to manage api requests
* Manually tested routes assignments and classes to be able to make them more robust
* made new checks for boundary cases in submit route

## Goals for next cycle
* Test our backend services more and try to automate it as soon as possible
* Add more routes with more functions between our tables
* Add more editing and functionalities in our schema (to make their flow logical)

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Since I had a final exam on Friday June 28, I cannot work on many things but I worked on creating the Student Routes which includes all the function a student can access on our site, including get assignment, rubric, group, class, group members and also update group info if enrolled
* I also worked on modifying classes routes to make them more robust and added checks to them for boundary cases
* Currently worked on creating routes for Review, Submission and Grades, which includes all the basic CRUD operations for all three as well as segregating them into routes, controllers and service page as decided in team meetings.

## Goals for next cycle
* keep working on the routes and make them more accessible and robust in nature
* work on admin functionality and add suitable features as outlined in our project plan
* add more routes to students/classes to make more features available to the user

## Recap on goals from last cycle
* Worked on creating the CRUD and error testing most of my API endpoints. I didn't want them to just do basic operations but they should also be attentive to the other fields we have set
* Error management and constantly running them to check for mistakes
* Created more connectivity for rubrics and criterion and also added a new Groups table while updating schema

## Goals for next cycle
* I am planning to do little things this next cycle as i have a final exam on Friday, which is why i am planning to finish setting up basic CRUD ops for groups
* If time left, I'll start to do more advanced API endpoints such as get grades for students and get grades for class

* Complete API endpoints for most of our operations, hopefully 
* Run DB tests successfully 
* Make API endpoints fool proof and secure

Worked on creating the backend setup using PostgreSQL and created a DB design and documentation as well 1 hr

Worked on creating the backend and endpoint requests using Node.js and PostgreSQL - 2.5 hrs

Working on creating the backend setup using Node.js and for all tables

*Completed*

1. Node.js setup is completed and latest version of node and postgres has been uploaded. (Task size - small to medium)

2. API and endpoint request has been up and running which handles most of our DB connections and CRUD operations (task size -large)

*In Progress*

1. Prisma integrations and use with JavaScript is in WIP

2. Authentication for Passport.js and bcrypt.js is almost done just needs few touchups

*Recap on week's goals:*

1. This week was about getting the stuff to move and ready to implement various functionalities. We've been looking into various integrations and setups so as to make coding easier and efficient.

2. I have setup the basic requirements and tested the backend networks for our system

3. Focus was on velocity and getting ready to combine different pieces of features into one

*Next Cycle Goals:*

I aim to finish the authentication parts of the backend using Passport.js and bcrypt.js. I also intend to finish revising on tech like React.js and Redux which we'll be using mostly for frontend. I will also try to give more hours into the development and setting up integrations with Prisma ORM.

**WEEK 1 (May 26 - June 1)**

Worked on creating the project requirements section including UVP to Usage

Worked on creating the sections for the video adding the audio files with the video

Working on database design, creating multiple tables with relationship diagrams. Additionally, working on setting up PostgreSQL so that everyone can work on it.

Creating a template for the tables and the design of our website
