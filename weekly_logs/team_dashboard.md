*  Possibly refactoring some prisma database calls

*  Cleaning up the rest of the application

*  Refactoring back-end testing 
  

### Team Issues and Hurdles for c-16
*  We discussed about the time we have to finish up the Peer Reviews and Grades, we are currently working on the Peer Reviews and Grades and will trying to finishing up the Peer Reviews and Grades in the next cycle.
  
*  With what time we have left, we made the decision to scrap trying to complete Group Reviews and other Group related things, since we are not sure both Peer Reviews, grades, and other bug fixes. 
  
*  Our plan going forward is to fully finish up Peer Reviews and Grades then focus on cleaning up the rest of the application, even if we aren't able to complete all features we want to have a clean application with few to no bugs.

* We also need to update our testing suite for the back-end, many api calls are not testing properly as things are constantly changing and being added to the application.

### Team Issues and Hurdles for c-7

* Other members also had Finals or were finishing up other classes so attention to the project was slighly deferred 
  
*  There are still some existing UI integrations that need to be done, also we realized there is no session management in the front-end so when the page is manually refreshed no components render, so we need to tweak this as well.

### Team Issues and Hurdles for c-5
*  Honestly largest issue you could say is that we are like 75% done on most of these major use cases,
   we just neeed to integrate the backend and our UI together. I know mahir already started making an API calls
   folder so we just need to set-up the calls in our front-end to make everything unified
  
* Also, we need to think about how to do dynamic page-redirects for auth related things, I believe we can do this redux
  But we don't know yet if that would be a security concern moving forward.
