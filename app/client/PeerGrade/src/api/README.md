### How to Access data from the api calls: 
Api call responses are send as such
* Status = Success or Error
* Message = Some arbitratary message
* data = optional data returned by the response 

To access the optional data response, I.E returning class data,  you must do .data for whatever const you are acessing in your apiCalls
